# 🎮 UniRetro

**UniRetro** is a bird's-eye view 2D digital recreation of the
Azerbaijan Architecture and Construction University campus built using
GameMaker Studio. The project is mainly a learning experience focused on
level design, top-down movement systems, and recreating a real-world
environment in a simple interactive format.

This is not a fully realistic simulation --- it's more like a playable
digital campus map made by a student developer learning game development
step by step.
